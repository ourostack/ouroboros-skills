# Desk Snapshot Artifacts

Committed snapshot artifacts live under:

```text
plugins/desk/artifacts/snapshots/<embedding-spec-id>/<snapshot-id>.sqlite.zst
plugins/desk/artifacts/snapshots/<embedding-spec-id>/<snapshot-id>.manifest.json
plugins/desk/artifacts/snapshots/<embedding-spec-id>/<snapshot-id>.sha256
```

Snapshots are compressed SQLite index caches. They are derivative artifacts and
must be validated before restore. The sidecar manifest records the embedding
spec, chunker and normalization IDs, DB schema, sqlite-vec/runtime
compatibility, artifact source-scope hash, document tree hash, included vector
pack IDs, creation time, artifact checksum, provenance, and source paths.

Source-scope or document-tree hash mismatches are freshness signals, not hard
compatibility failures. Schema, embedding, runtime, artifact checksum, unsafe
path, or provenance failures make the snapshot incompatible.
