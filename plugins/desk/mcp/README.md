# desk MCP server

Spawned by consumers (Claude Code, Copilot CLI, ouroboros daemon) to expose a uniform tool surface for working with a desk workspace. Tools include task / track / friction / lesson CRUD and hybrid lexical+semantic search.

## Run it directly

```sh
node ./index.js --root ~/AgentBundles/<agent>.ouro/desk
```

Or via environment:

```sh
DESK=~/<your-workspace> node ./index.js
```

## Tools exposed (13)

**Runtime CRUD:**
- `task_create`, `task_update`, `task_archive`
- `track_create`, `track_update`
- `friction_add`, `lesson_add`

**Search:**
- `desk_search` — hybrid lexical + semantic
- `desk_recall` — semantic-only loose recall with auto-clustering
- `desk_similar` — find docs similar to a given path
- `desk_timeline` — temporal queries
- `desk_thread` — provenance walk via refs_graph
- `desk_reindex` — rebuild or repair the local search index

All 13 tools are wired to real implementations.

## How consumers wire this up

The plugin's sibling `.mcp.json` (at `plugins/desk/.mcp.json`) declares the spawn:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desk": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["${pluginRoot}/mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Hosts materialize `${pluginRoot}` to the installed Desk plugin root before launching. Claude Code reads this natively. Copilot CLI inherits the same spec. Ouroboros bundles read `.mcp.json` from the bundled Desk plugin.

## Generic stdio MCP launch

Generic stdio hosts can launch Desk as an MCP-only server, but generic stdio does not activate `worker` and does not resolve plugin dependencies for Work Suite.

Bind the root explicitly:

```sh
DESK=~/desk
node /path/to/plugins/desk/mcp/index.js --root "$DESK"
```

If the host cannot pass environment variables, pass the same concrete path directly:

```sh
node /path/to/plugins/desk/mcp/index.js --root ~/desk
```

This path provides MCP tools only; there is no worker activation, default agent preamble, or plugin dependency closure.

## Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` — MCP server framework
- `better-sqlite3` — local SQLite for the search index
- `sqlite-vec` — vector search extension
- `gray-matter` — YAML frontmatter parser

`sqlite-vec` and `better-sqlite3` are native deps; if `npm install` fails on a platform, try `npm install --build-from-source`.

Semantic ranking requires Ollama with `nomic-embed-text` pulled. The MCP resolves the embedding endpoint in this order: explicit test/tool `endpoint`, `DESK_EMBED_ENDPOINT`, `DESK_OLLAMA_ENDPOINT`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, `http://127.0.0.1:11434`, then `http://localhost:11434`. Set `DESK_EMBED_MODEL` to override `nomic-embed-text`, and `DESK_EMBED_TIMEOUT_MS` to adjust the per-endpoint timeout.

If Ollama is unavailable, search soft-falls-back to FTS5-only with `semantic_unavailable` plus `semantic_diagnostic` and `semantic_repair` fields in the response. If a desk was indexed while Ollama was down, `desk_reindex` without arguments now repairs missing vectors automatically once embeddings are reachable; `force:true` is only needed when you intentionally want to drop and rebuild the whole DB.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

Boots the server with a temp root and asserts the 12 tool names register, then exercises every tool's real body via the dispatcher and fixture-desks. 103 tests at v1.0.
