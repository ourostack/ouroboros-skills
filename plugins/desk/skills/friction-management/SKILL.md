description: How worker maintains the operator's friction log — appending new entries during real use, updating `Status:` lines when fixes land, and archiving landed/partial entries so the live log stays signal-dense. Friction scope is pain points in HOW worker operated (mental models, tooling blind spots, communication misses), not the operational content of tasks worker is helping with — that goes in task cards or track-level lessons. Use when capturing a new such pain point, when a friction item's fix ships in worker, or when the friction log grows past ~150 lines and open items start getting buried.

# Friction management

the corkboard above the desk is where i pin the things that snagged. `$DESK/_meta/friction.md` is the operator-wide corkboard; each track has its own smaller one at `<track>/_friction/friction.md` for pain that belongs to just that drawer. operators pin cards when real use snags; future sessions take cards down and turn them into fixes. the corkboard only works if it stays readable — if it fills up with cards whose fixes already shipped, the still-open ones get lost behind them, and the whole thing goes quiet.

this skill governs three small motions: pin a new card, mark a card landed, and move the landed card off the corkboard in the same breath. before any of those, though, the question of *whether* a thing belongs on the corkboard at all — that's the first cut.

## What goes on the corkboard

friction is about how *i* operated — my mental models, tooling blind spots, communication misses, mistaken first-pass conclusions. when i hit a rough edge in HOW i was doing the work, that's a friction card.

friction is NOT the work's operational subject matter. when i'm helping with substrate operations / external-system gotchas / a tricky debugging session, those details belong in the task card or in the track's lessons-learned — not on the corkboard. those are notes about the thing being worked on, not about me.

quick test: would a different agent (different model, different runtime) hit this same rough edge when doing similar work? if yes → friction (the snag is in my shape). if it's specific to the system / API / external thing being interacted with → task or track-level lessons.

mixing the two dulls the corkboard. operational knowledge is task knowledge — it goes where the work is. the corkboard exists so future sessions of me can find patterns in how i operate, not to re-document the systems i operate on.

## 1. Pin a new card

when the operator hits friction, or when i notice a recurring rough edge:

1. decide the scope. is this operator-wide (`_meta/friction.md`), or does it belong to one drawer (`<track>/_friction/friction.md`)? default to operator-wide; use track-local only when the issue is tightly coupled to one track's work.
2. append a new entry at the END of the file using this format:

   ```markdown
   ## YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

   **Context** (optional, use when background matters): <one paragraph>.

   **What happened**: <what went wrong — concrete, specific>.

   **Why it hurt**: <impact — what broke, how much time, what's at risk>.

   **Proposed fix**: <specific, actionable. Prefer a numbered list when multiple paths exist>.

   **Status**: open.
   ```

3. commit + push to the desk workspace. no separate review step; the corkboard is live evidence.

### Pin the card while it's still warm

pin friction during the activity that surfaced it, not after.
mid-meeting / mid-debug / mid-review captures preserve the
surface-level detail (specific tool result, exact phrasing,
immediate cost, the sequence of events that made the failure mode
visible) that fades within hours. post-hoc capture compresses
nuance into "we hit X" without the Y and Z that made X hurt.

the bias is toward writing the entry while the failure is still
fresh, even if it interrupts the activity for thirty seconds. the
alternative — "i'll write it up after the meeting" — produces
shallower entries that miss the specific friction surface and end
up under-leveraged when curator processes the backlog.

a short live-capture entry is more useful than a long after-the-fact
one. capture the cost first ("burned a tool-result of context", "lost
ten minutes", "operator caught at last possible moment"), then expand
to root cause once the activity wraps. the cost-first frame anchors
the entry to evidence and resists drift toward post-hoc rationalization.

## 2. Mark a card landed

when a fix ships in the owning plugin or repo that resolves a card on the corkboard:

1. update the entry's `**Status**:` line. format:

   ```markdown
   **Status**: landed in <repo> commit `<sha>` (PR #N) — <one-line summary of how the fix addresses the friction>.
   ```

   if the fix is only partial, use `partial` and spell out what remains open.

2. **in the SAME commit**, take the card off the corkboard. see section 3.

**why same commit:** a card marked `landed` but still pinned is easy to miss — readers scan down the file and all they see is friction, landed or not. the canonical state of the corkboard is "pinned = still open." mixing landed in with open dulls the whole board.

## 3. Take the card down — same motion as mark-landed

move landed/partial entries into `_meta/_archive/friction-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (or `<track>/_friction/_archive/friction-YYYY-MM-DD.md` for track-local). landed cards aren't thrown away — they slide into the back of the room, still browsable, still mine.

### Archive file naming

- **per-date**: `friction-YYYY-MM-DD.md` — groups entries archived on the same date.
- **per-theme** (when a batch of related entries lands together): `friction-YYYY-MM-DD-<theme>.md` — e.g., `friction-2026-04-17-windows-prereqs.md`.

use per-theme when 3+ entries land in one sweep with a shared story (e.g., "all the first-Windows-run friction"). use per-date otherwise.

### Archive file structure

```markdown
# Friction archive — <YYYY-MM-DD>[<theme>]

Entries archived from `_meta/friction.md` on <YYYY-MM-DD>. Each is landed or partial — see the Status line at the bottom of each entry.

---

<entry 1 — full body including the Status line>

---

<entry 2 — full body including the Status line>

---
```

entries keep their original bodies verbatim — no rewording when archiving. the archive is evidence, not a summary.

### The single-motion rule

archiving must happen in the SAME git commit as the `Status: landed` update. commit message pattern:

```
friction: archive landed — <comma-separated short titles> (<sha>s)

Entries moved from _meta/friction.md to _meta/_archive/friction-<date>[-<theme>].md.
Status lines updated in the archived copy with the shipping commit sha.
```

splitting the mark-landed and archive steps leaves a window where `friction.md` has inconsistent state (some landed entries still pinned, others already in the back). always atomic.

## 4. When the corkboard fills up past ~150 lines

even with open-only-on-the-board, an operator can accumulate open cards faster than they fix them. if `_meta/friction.md` grows past ~150 lines, consider:

- **group by theme** in the archive when you eventually land a batch.
- **add a brief summary at the top of `friction.md`** — e.g. "N open entries across [themes]" — so the shape of the board is visible at a glance.

do NOT aggressively close entries just to shrink the log. open means unresolved; the corkboard is evidence, not a todo list.

## 5. Never delete, never rewrite

- don't delete entries, even landed ones. archive them.
- don't edit an entry's original `What happened` / `Why it hurt` / `Proposed fix` after it's written. those are the operator's in-the-moment capture; rewriting them loses the signal of what they actually experienced.
- only the `Status:` line changes after initial write. everything else is append-only evidence.
