description: Browse, install, update, and contribute skills from the ouroboros-skills shared repository. This is the bootstrap skill that teaches agents how to manage their skill library.
---

This skill teaches agents how to discover, install, track, update, and contribute skills from the shared `ouroboros-skills` repository. It is the bootstrap skill -- once an agent has this skill installed, it can self-serve all other skills.

## Concepts

**Skills repo**: `github.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills` -- a public repo containing shared skill definitions as `SKILL.md` files.

**Manifest**: `manifest.json` at the repo root -- a machine-readable index of all available skills with names, paths, descriptions, and tags.

**Registry**: `_registry.json` -- a local file in the agent's skills directory that tracks which skills are installed, where they came from, and when they were last updated.

**Skills directory**: The local directory where the agent stores installed skills. Location depends on the runtime (see below).

### Runtime Directory Layouts

| Layout | Skills directory | Example installed skill path |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| Host-managed skills root | `<host-home>/skills/` | `<host-home>/skills/work-planner/SKILL.md` |
| Agent-managed skills root | `~/.agents/skills/` | `~/.agents/skills/work-planner/SKILL.md` |
| Ouroboros bundle | `~/AgentBundles/<agent>.ouro/skills/` | `~/AgentBundles/myagent.ouro/skills/work-planner/SKILL.md` |

Detect which runtime you are in:
1. Prefer the skills root exposed by the current host app.
2. If `~/.agents/skills/` exists, use it as an agent-managed skills root.
3. If the user specifies an Ouroboros bundle path, use that.
4. If multiple roots are active, manage each root separately.
5. If ambiguous, ask the user.

The `_registry.json` file always lives at the root of each skills directory.

## 1. Browse: Discover Available Skills

Query the manifest to see what skills are available.

### Steps

1. Fetch the manifest:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/main/manifest.json
   ```
2. Parse the JSON. The schema is:
   ```json
   {
     "skills": [
       {
         "name": "skill-name",
         "path": "skills/skill-name/SKILL.md",
         "description": "One-line description of what the skill does.",
         "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
3. Present the list to the user or filter by tags/keywords as needed.
4. To read a skill's full content before installing, fetch:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/main/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```

---

## 2. Install: Add a Skill Locally

Fetch a skill from the repo and install it into the local skills directory.

### Steps

1. Determine the skills directory for the current runtime (see table above).
2. Create the skill subdirectory if it does not exist:
   ```
   mkdir -p <skills-dir>/<skill-name>/
   ```
3. Install the complete upstream skill directory, not only `SKILL.md`, because modern skills may include `agents/`, `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`:
   ```bash
   tmpdir="$(mktemp -d)"
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills.git "$tmpdir/ouroboros-skills"
   git -C "$tmpdir/ouroboros-skills" sparse-checkout set "skills/<skill-name>"
   rsync -a --delete "$tmpdir/ouroboros-skills/skills/<skill-name>/" "<skills-dir>/<skill-name>/"
   rm -rf "$tmpdir"
   ```
   If `git` is unavailable but `gh` is available, download the directory recursively through the GitHub contents API. If neither can fetch a directory, stop and report that the install would be incomplete; do not silently install only `SKILL.md` for a skill that has bundled resources.
4. To inspect or manually repair the main skill file, fetch the raw `SKILL.md` content:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/main/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
   ```
5. Get the latest commit SHA for the complete upstream skill directory:
   ```bash
   # Use the GitHub API to get the latest commit touching any file in the skill directory
   curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/commits?path=skills/<skill-name>&per_page=1" | jq -r '.[0].sha'
   ```
6. Update `_registry.json` (see Track Provenance below).

### Verification

After install, confirm:
- `<skills-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` exists and is non-empty.
- Bundled resources listed in the upstream directory, such as `agents/`, `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`, are present locally.
- `_registry.json` has an entry for the skill.

### Runtime Refresh After Install Or Update

Installing a skill on disk is not always enough for the current host session to list it in the active skill menu. After installing or updating any skill that affects the current workstream:

1. Refresh every active skills root that the runtime consumes (`~/.agents/skills`, host-managed Codex skills, plugin bundle copies, or the explicit bundle path the user named).
2. Re-read the installed `SKILL.md` from disk and treat it as the source of truth for the current run even if the host menu will not refresh until a new session.
3. When working with work-suite skills, run the runtime visibility audit from the `ouroboros-skills` repo when available:
   ```bash
   node scripts/audit-work-suite-runtime.cjs --repo-root /path/to/ouroboros-skills \
     --skill-root ~/.agents/skills \
     --skill-root ~/.codex/skills \
     --active-skills <comma-separated active host-menu skill names>
   ```
4. Record the refresh and any active-menu mismatch in durable state when an autopilot/no-human-gates mandate is active.
5. Dogfood the updated behavior on the next real task before claiming the skill change is done.

---

## 3. Track Provenance: Maintain _registry.json

The `_registry.json` file lives at the skills directory root and tracks all installed skills.

### Bootstrap or Repair a Missing Registry

If `_registry.json` is missing but the skills directory already contains installed skills, do not treat that as "no skills installed" and do not silently skip freshness checks. Bootstrap the registry first.

Steps:

1. Determine every active skills directory for the runtime. Some host apps expose split roots, such as an agent-managed root plus an app-managed root; each root gets its own `_registry.json`.
2. Fetch the shared manifest:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/main/manifest.json
   ```
3. For each local skill directory containing `SKILL.md`:
   - If the skill name appears in the manifest, compare the full local skill directory against the upstream `skills/<skill-name>/` directory, and fetch the latest commit SHA for the directory path.
   - If the local directory is byte-for-byte identical to upstream, add a normal shared-skill registry entry with `source`, `commit`, `installed`, and `selfAuthored: false`.
   - If any local file differs from upstream, including bundled `agents/`, `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`, preserve the local directory and add a local/self-authored registry entry with `source: "local"`, `commit: ""`, `installed`, and `selfAuthored: true`. Report that it is a local adaptation instead of overwriting it.
   - If the skill name is not in the manifest, add the same local/self-authored registry entry.
4. Write `_registry.json` as formatted JSON at the root of that skills directory.
5. Validate by parsing the written JSON and reporting:
   - shared skills now tracked against upstream
   - local/self-authored skills intentionally excluded from upstream freshness updates
   - any manifest skills missing locally that the user may want to install

Freshness checks must fail closed when `_registry.json` is missing. Print the exact skills directory and tell the agent to run this bootstrap/repair flow before comparing commits. A missing registry is repairable state, not a reason to proceed with ad-hoc freshness guesses.

### Schema

```json
{
  "<skill-name>": {
    "source": "https://github.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/tree/main/skills/<skill-name>",
    "commit": "<sha of the commit that last touched this skill directory>",
    "installed": "<ISO 8601 datetime of when the skill was installed or last updated>",
    "selfAuthored": false
  }
}
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `source` | string | The GitHub directory URL the skill was fetched from. |
| `commit` | string | The SHA of the latest commit that touched the skill directory at time of install/update. |
| `installed` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp (e.g., `2026-03-18T13:30:00Z`) of when the skill was installed or last updated. |
| `selfAuthored` | boolean | `true` if the skill was written locally by the agent/user (not fetched from the repo). `false` for skills installed from the shared repo. |

### Rules

- When installing a new skill, add an entry.
- When updating a skill, update `commit` and `installed`.
- When a user creates a local skill (not from the repo), set `selfAuthored: true` and `source` to `"local"`.
- Never delete entries -- even if a skill is uninstalled, keep the record for audit trail. Add an `"uninstalled": "<ISO date>"` field instead.
- If `_registry.json` does not exist, create it as an empty object `{}` before adding the first entry.

## 4. Update: Check for and Apply Skill Updates

Compare locally installed skills against the latest versions in the repo.

### Steps

1. Read `_registry.json` from the skills directory.
2. Fetch the manifest:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/main/manifest.json
   ```
3. For each skill in `_registry.json` where `selfAuthored` is `false`:
   a. Get the latest commit SHA for the complete skill directory from the GitHub API:
      ```bash
      curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/ourostack/ouroboros-skills/commits?path=skills/<skill-name>&per_page=1" | jq -r '.[0].sha'
      ```
   b. Compare against the `commit` field in `_registry.json`.
   c. If they differ, the skill has been updated upstream.
4. Report which skills are stale.
5. For each stale skill, offer to update:
   - Install the complete upstream skill directory using the same full-directory copy flow as Install.
   - Replace the local skill directory atomically enough that stale bundled resources are removed. For example, copy into a temporary `<skills-dir>/<skill-name>.tmp`, verify `SKILL.md` exists, then `rm -rf <skills-dir>/<skill-name>.old`, move the current directory aside, move the temp directory into place, and remove the old directory after validation.
   - Update `commit` and `installed` in `_registry.json`.
6. If the update affects the current workflow and autopilot/no-human-gates is active, apply the Runtime Refresh steps above instead of returning control with "restart to pick this up" as the only outcome.

### Freshness Check (Quick)

For a fast staleness check without full update:
1. Read `_registry.json`.
2. For each non-self-authored skill, compare the local `commit` SHA against the latest commit touching the upstream `skills/<skill-name>` directory from the API.
3. Report: "X skills up to date, Y skills have updates available."

## 5. Contribute: Add a New Skill to the Repo

Guide the agent through contributing a new skill to the shared repo.

### Steps

1. **Fork**: Fork `ourostack/ouroboros-skills` to the contributor's GitHub account.
2. **Clone**: Clone the fork locally.
3. **Create branch**: Create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/add-<skill-name>`).
4. **Create skill directory**: `skills/<skill-name>/`
5. **Write SKILL.md**: The file must include:
   - YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description` fields.
   - Clear workflow instructions that another agent can follow.
   - No hardcoded paths or user-specific configuration.
6. **Update manifest.json**: Add an entry for the new skill:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "<skill-name>",
     "path": "skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md",
     "description": "<description from frontmatter>",
     "tags": ["<relevant>", "<tags>"]
   }
   ```
7. **Commit and push**: Commit all changes and push to the fork.
8. **Open PR**: Open a pull request against `ourostack/ouroboros-skills` main branch.
   - Title: `feat: add <skill-name> skill`
   - Body: Describe what the skill does and when agents should use it.

### SKILL.md Requirements

Every skill file must:
- Have YAML frontmatter with at least `name` and `description`.
- Be self-contained -- an agent should be able to follow the skill using only the SKILL.md content.
- Not reference external files that are not part of the skill directory.
- Use clear, imperative instructions (the audience is an AI agent, not a human developer).

### Frontmatter limits (hard -- enforced in CI)

Per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification), the frontmatter has hard limits. A skill that breaks them **fails to load** in the Copilot CLI and other Agent Skills runtimes:

- `name`: at most 64 characters, lowercase `a-z0-9` and single hyphens, and must match the skill's directory name.
- `description`: non-empty, **at most 1024 characters**. This is the limit that bites most often: only `name` + `description` are pre-loaded into the agent's context for every installed skill, so the runtime caps the description hard.

`scripts/validate-skills.cjs` enforces both on every skill in CI (`validateSkillDescriptionLimits`). Run it locally before opening a PR.

### Writing the description (all-signal, no noise)

The description is a **router, not a summary**. Its only job is to help an agent pick this skill over ~100 others, so every token must earn its place by doing *discrimination*, not *explanation*. Include exactly three things:

1. **What** it does -- one concrete clause, third person ("Sync-and-merge agent. Fetches origin/main, ..."). Never first or second person -- the description is injected into the system prompt, and mixed point-of-view hurts discovery.
2. **When** to use it -- the real trigger phrases and contexts a user actually says.
3. **When NOT** to use it, or which sibling skill to use instead -- the disambiguators. These earn their tokens precisely because skills overlap.

Leave everything else to the body (the spec's *progressive disclosure*: the body loads only once the skill is chosen). Cut from the description: mechanism / how it works, rationale / motivation, exhaustive "covers A, B, C, D, E" feature lists, and anything that merely restates the body.

The 1024 cap is a ceiling, not a target. Most good descriptions land well under it (`work-merger` ~250, `emu-github` ~450 characters). If yours is brushing 1024, it is explaining, not routing -- cut it down.

**YAML-safe format.** Write the description as a `>-` folded block scalar, so colons, quotes, and punctuation cannot break the YAML:

```yaml
name: my-skill
description: >-
  One clause on what it does, third person. Use when the user says
  trigger-phrase-a or trigger-phrase-b. Not for the adjacent case (use
  other-skill instead).
```

Avoid raw angle-bracket tokens in the description (the spec disallows XML tags). Confirm the file parses before committing -- the CI check above is the backstop.

## 6. Improve: Propose Changes to Existing Skills

Guide the agent through proposing improvements to skills already in the repo.

### Steps

1. **Fork** (if not already forked): Fork `ourostack/ouroboros-skills`.
2. **Clone/update**: Clone or pull the latest from the fork.
3. **Create branch**: Create a feature branch (e.g., `improve/<skill-name>-<brief-description>`).
4. **Make changes**: Edit the skill's `SKILL.md` file.
   - Preserve the existing YAML frontmatter `name` field.
   - Update `description` if the scope of the skill changed.
   - Keep the skill self-contained.
5. **Update manifest.json** if the description or tags changed.
6. **Commit and push**: Commit with a clear message explaining what was improved and why.
7. **Open PR**: Open a pull request against `ourostack/ouroboros-skills` main branch.
   - Title: `improve(<skill-name>): <brief description of change>`
   - Body: Explain what was changed, why, and how it improves the skill.

### When to Improve vs. Contribute

- **Improve**: The skill exists but could be better (clearer instructions, missing edge cases, better structure).
- **Contribute**: The skill does not exist yet and covers a new capability.
