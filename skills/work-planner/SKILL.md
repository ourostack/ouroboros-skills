# Work Planner

Plan only when the plan prevents a real mistake.

## Route

These are post-go lanes. Consume the existing alignment receipt before planning implementation; new work without an agreed outcome, definition of done, and explicit go-ahead returns to `work-ideator`. Skipping a planning document never skips alignment. Already-approved work reuses its contract.

- **Clear, local, low risk:** skip planning and implement.
- **Several coordinated files or a behavior change:** write or update a short doing-only document.
- **Cross-cutting, novel, or high risk:** write one planning document, then one doing document.

If a planning/doing pair already exists, reuse it. Update the current artifacts instead of creating competing plans.

## Ground

Before drafting, fetch every relevant repository and verify the checkout against the current target base. Read current source and repository instructions, then record the source refs and requirements that make the plan true.

Resolve only material unknowns. Choose one design. Apply Ponytail: reuse existing code, standard-library and native features, and installed dependencies before custom machinery.

## Write the contract

The planning document records objective, evidence, chosen design, scope, non-goals, risks, validation, and decisions. The doing document contains dependency-ordered vertical slices with concrete acceptance.

Every behavior-changing slice names:

- the test or fixture written before implementation and its observed red;
- the minimum green behavior;
- repository-required coverage for new and modified production logic, including error, null, empty, boundary, and negative paths with no changed-file exclusion, plus semantic acceptance evidence that challenges a material assumption with a counterexample;
- the build, full-suite, and consuming-surface proof required before completion.
- for a default-off feature or optional configuration-gated behavior, the owning contract, activation seam, every inactive state, and the characterization at the real routing boundary that proves the pre-change path survives.
- for every changed boundary, what callers observe on success and, when applicable, invalid input, dependency failure, timeout, cancellation, partial mutation, retry, duplication, and error translation.

Strict TDD requires an observed red: test first, record the intended failure, freeze the test, implement the minimal green, then refactor while green. UI or rendered-output work also invokes `visual-qa-dogfood`.

### Preserve confirmed customer decisions

When customer-visible behavior differs by status, lifecycle state, type, origin, role, host, platform, permission, or feature configuration, record each canonical value separately with the customer situation, inclusion harm, exclusion harm, evidence, recommendation, strongest counterargument, confirmed outcome, and exact confirming authority. Derive that inventory from the producing or owning contract, not from a display label, UI grouping, or umbrella term that combines outcomes with different customer purposes. Never combine distinct values or select or exclude one because implementation is easier. An unresolved conflict means the planning document is not ready.

Before marking a doing document ready, reconcile every confirmed decision and acceptance criterion to the chosen design, a planned implementation slice, its falsifiable test, and consuming-surface proof. Missing, contradictory, or implementation-narrowed entries remain unresolved.

The same rule applies when a later discovery would change a confirmed component boundary, public contract, state owner, trust model, or compatibility policy. Do not silently replace the decision because a new direction is safer, more repository-consistent, or supported by reviewer consensus. Record the supersession and obtain the confirming authority for the changed outcome.

### Settle durable contracts before propagation

Before creating a durable contract or generating its consumers, read the proposed name and shape at the call site without implementation context. Resolve material ambiguity before it propagates into generated clients, tests, telemetry, documentation, or downstream consumers. Internal consistency after propagation is not evidence that the original name and shape were clear.

## Review

Review matches the route:

- **Doing-only:** run one fresh cold reviewer selected by the dominant risk. Use **Tinfoil Hat** for omissions, dependencies, failure paths, and trust boundaries; use **Stranger With Candy** for plausible-but-false semantics, ownership, and canonical-state claims.
- **Cross-cutting, novel, or high risk:** run both Tinfoil Hat and Stranger With Candy as fresh zero-context reviewers against the same source and document hashes.

A top-level host uses native subagents or fresh isolated subprocess sessions. A nested host emits complete reviewer briefs, marks the artifact not ready, and returns the obligation to its parent. Inline self-review does not satisfy the gate.

Fix blocker and major findings, then recheck the changed surface once. Do not add generic review ladders, no-change commits, or default operator approval.

## Hand off

Mark the doing document ready and hand it to `work-doer`. A planning document is a tool, not a prerequisite.
