name: linkedin-profile
description: >-
  Author and publish a complete LinkedIn profile that reads like the operator,
  not like a model: goal, audience model, verbatim voice capture, fold-first
  drafting, section-by-section locks (About, Headline, Experience, Featured,
  Skills, small fields), browser publishing with character-level verification,
  then a rubric audit loop. Invoke when the user asks to refresh, rewrite,
  audit, or fix their LinkedIn profile or any section of it. Do NOT invoke for
  LinkedIn posts/content strategy, or for resumes (different artifact,
  different rules).

# linkedin-profile

Author a LinkedIn profile end to end — strategy, copy, publishing, audit — with the operator's
voice as the load-bearing material and the agent as editor, publisher, and verifier.

## Stance

- **The operator's voice is the material. You are the editor.** Every failed draft in this
  skill's history failed the same way: a model guessed at voice and performed a persona — brooding
  movie-voiceover openers, comparison-to-"most people", aphorisms.
  Capture real voice first (interview, chat transcripts, things they've actually written),
  then compose from it. Their verbatim words are privileged input — but *compose*, don't
  string-replace their phrases into slots.
- **The evaluator is the bottleneck, not the generator.** Model judges will score
  polished-wrong drafts 9+/10. Audience simulations and reviewer agents are *detectors* —
  prompt them to falsify, never to approve. The only gate that counts is the operator.
- **While drafting: one section at a time, one decision per exchange.** Never dump the
  whole profile for review. Lock the section, then move. (Audit phase inverts this:
  batch all judgment calls into one group — see step 8.)

## Workflow

1. **Goal first.** One primary conversion: active job search, passive optionality, thought
   leadership, founder/fundraising, sales, hiring, or consulting. Everything downstream
   serves it, including what NOT to enable (frames, CTAs, notification blasts).
2. **Audience model.** Rank the real readers: (a) post-contact lookups ("who is this
   person?"), (b) the goal audience (the people the positioning is *for* — they read
   everything and smell slop), (c) skimming scanners (recruiters/sourcers — headline, title,
   tenure, first two About lines), (d) amplifiers (press, organizers). Plus a **constraint
   audience**: current colleagues and leadership read this too — nothing that over-claims
   or reads cynical from inside.
3. **Voice capture.** Interview conversationally (no forms). Get the origin story AND the
   present in their own words. Save the transcript verbatim; it outranks every draft.
4. **Fold first.** The first ~200 characters of the About (mobile fold; desktop shows
   ~275+) are the highest-leverage copy on the profile. Iterate the fold as a standalone
   artifact in chat — cheap, fast, and it constrains everything downstream.
5. **Section order:** About (anchor) → Headline (falls out of it) → Experience (current
   role first) → Featured → Skills → small fields. Visuals (photo/banner) are the
   operator's design call; offer specs and candidates, never push.
6. **Redline loop.** Draft whole sections; let the operator edit in a real editor (or
   paste-and-markup). Respond with **whole-piece passes, never line patches** — patching
   the pointed-at line while the same disease lives elsewhere is the #1 trust-burner.
   Keep a running kill list of every word, phrase, and move the operator rejects; treat
   it as binding law for all future drafts, and store it durably alongside the voice
   transcript in the operator's workspace.
7. **Publish** (browser automation) with the verification discipline below.
8. **Audit** the live profile against the rubric until a pass finds nothing real. Batch
   anything needing operator judgment into ONE group at the end.

## Craft laws

- **The razor: no word that isn't necessary.** Applies to every artifact and to your own
  chat messages.
- **So-what first.** Every bullet leads with the change, not the activity. Story is carried
  by the *sequence* of outcomes, not by narration.
- **Bare facts; nothing argues for its own significance.** Kill on sight: clauses that
  justify a line's presence, journey narration that performs difficulty, manufactured
  outcome frames, scale announcements, transition meta-narration, validation ticks
  ("actually", "always").
- **Show, never label.** No self-labels (visionary, builder, thought leader). Only facts:
  shipped X, founded Y, maintain Z. If a line sounds quotable, cut it.
- **No context-dependent jokes.** A joke that needs backstory reads as noise (or worse) to
  a cold reader. The test: every line must work for someone who knows nothing.
- **Verb truth and proportion truth.** Never inflate ("worked on" ≠ "built and ran");
  never let a footnote project read as the era's main work. Junior eras stay junior.
- **Provenance and disclosure are separate gates.** Before polishing, classify every load-bearing claim twice: factual support and publication clearance. Claims of priority (`first`, `coined`, `origin`), market-wide universals, and quantified system, business, product, or market scale require a primary public source; otherwise remove the unsupported priority, universal, or scale element. If the bounded underlying point is still useful, recast only that point as an explicit first-person observation.
- **Firsthand truth does not release internal detail.** Operator attestation is enough for truthful personal and high-altitude role descriptions. Employer-internal metrics, architecture, dependencies, adoption scope, security, and cross-team details need an existing public disclosure basis or must be generalized or cut. Independent coinage is rendered as `I call this...` or `I champion...`, not historical priority.
- **No keyword stuffing in prose.** Searchable terms live structurally: headline segments,
  skills, title fields. An About that says "agentic workflows" reads as written by a bot.
- **Mentorship/culture claims need concrete, publication-cleared scope or outcome** (method and what changed; counts only when publicly supportable) or they fold into another bullet as a plain noun. Unquantified virtue lines are definitionally slop.
- **Layers retell one story at different resolutions.** A deliberate one-sentence echo
  across headline/About/entry is coherence; same-resolution duplication is a defect.
- **Run the `humanize` skill on every published line** (it owns the AI-tell rules; don't
  restate them). Profile-specific delta: if closes keep failing, the strongest close is none.

## Section mechanics (re-verify limits live before load-bearing use)

- **Headline:** ~220 chars; first ~60 must stand alone in search cards. Separator-segment
  form scans well: 2-4 segments — who you are, what category, what proof.
- **About:** ~2,600 max, 1,100–1,800 sweet spot. First-person. Paragraph breaks survive.
- **Experience:** ~2,000/entry. Current role carries the weight (bullet-hybrid or
  bare-facts prose); older roles are 1–3 line period pieces; delete "Technologies used:"
  cruft. Title changes at one company = separate position entries; the company header
  renders total tenure automatically — never write it into copy. Multiple *current*
  positions sort newest-start-first: use the reorder tool to put the anchor first (same
  for Featured — newest-added lands first).
- **Skills:** cap 100; pin top 5 to mirror the headline story; associate skills to
  positions when adding; keep old off-goal skills unpinned if they hold endorsements.
- **Featured:** 3–5 items, strongest first, must *prove* the headline. Link cards pull
  og:image from the target — **a site with no og:image renders a permanent gray
  placeholder**; fix the site, force a re-scrape (LinkedIn Post Inspector), then delete/re-add the card.
- **Small fields:** Location and Industry are search filters — set deliberately; the custom URL is branding.
  Honors/Projects sections beat Experience entries for awards and bounded artifacts.

## Publishing verification (non-negotiable)

- **Silence the megaphone first.** Set the global "Share profile updates with your
  network" visibility setting OFF before the session, and flip the per-dialog Notify
  toggle off wherever a form shows one.
- **Synthetic typing drops characters randomly** in some form fields. After EVERY typed
  field: zoom-verify at character level; repair via word-select-and-retype (full-field
  retypes reproduce drops). After publishing: extract rendered text and machine-diff
  against locked copy. Never claim "published" from command echo — verify state.
- Expect save interstitials (upsells, connect-suggestions) — dismiss, never engage.
- Media/file uploads usually require a native file picker: operator territory. Say so.
- **Operate only inside the operator's already-authenticated browser session.** Never
  perform logins; any login wall, checkpoint, or CAPTCHA is operator territory, full
  stop. Pace edits like a human session — section by section, not a burst.

## Audit rubric (score 0–2 each; lowest sections = highest leverage)

Category clarity in 5 seconds · one story across headline/About/Featured/Experience ·
fold hooks · accomplishment-driven entries with publication-cleared evidence · pinned skills match the
story · Featured proves the headline with live thumbnails · fields set intentionally ·
no stale/contradicting content · verification badges present where eligible.
